## Usage
**Touch controls:**
- **Left Display:** Starts and stops timer
- **Right Display:** Tares weight and resets timer
- **Long Press (3 seconds):** Toggles between EspressiScale and Acaia-compatible BLE mode
  
**Power:**
  - Touch the display anywhere to wake it up
  - The scale will automatically enter deep sleep after 5min with no use

**Bluetooth:**
  - **EspressiScale mode:** The scale advertises as "EspressiScale" via Bluetooth
    - Compatible with Gaggiuino using the esp-arduino-ble-scales library
    - You can remotely tare the scale, start/stop/reset the timer, and receive weight and timer data
  - **Acaia-compatible mode:** The scale advertises as "Acaia" and mimics Acaia scale BLE protocol
    - Compatible with apps that support Acaia scales like Fellow, Artisan, and others
    - Provides the same functionality (weight, timer, tare) using the widely-supported Acaia protocol

**WiFi Configuration:**
  - EspressiScale creates a WiFi access point named "EspressiScale"
  - Default password: `Espress1Scale`
  - Connect to this network and your device should be redirected to a configuration portal
  - If not automatically redirected, open a browser and navigate to `192.168.4.1`
  - Follow the prompts to connect EspressiScale to your home WiFi network
  - Once connected, the scale's IP address will be displayed in the serial monitor

**Firmware Updates:**
  - After connecting EspressiScale to your WiFi network, access the update page by navigating to:
    `http://[scale-ip]/update` in your browser
  - Use this page to upload new firmware (.bin files)

**Update:**
   - Update using "scaleIP"/update
   - Build updated project
   - Upload the firmware.bin file

## Gaggiuino Integration

To integrate with Gaggiuino:

1. Make sure your Gaggiuino firmware includes the [esp-arduino-ble-scales](https://github.com/kstam/esp-arduino-ble-scales) library
2. Add the EspressiScale plugin to your Gaggiuino project by copying:
   - `esp-arduino-ble-scales/src/scales/espressiscale.h`
   - `esp-arduino-ble-scales/src/scales/espressiscale.cpp`
3. Add the following to your Gaggiuino initialization code:
   ```cpp
   #include "scales/espressiscale.h"
   
   void setup() {
     // ... other initialization code
     
     // Register the EspressiScale plugin
     EspressiScalesPlugin::apply();
     
     // ... other setup code
   }
   ```
4. Now your Gaggiuino should be able to automatically discover and connect to your EspressiScale

## BLE Protocol Modes

EspressiScale supports two different Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol modes:

1. **EspressiScale Native Protocol:**
   - Default mode with custom UUIDs
   - Designed specifically for EspressiScale
   - Compatible with Gaggiuino and other systems that implement the EspressiScale protocol

2. **Acaia-compatible Protocol:**
   - Mimics the protocol used by Acaia scales
   - Compatible with a wide range of existing coffee apps and equipment
   - Provides immediate compatibility with apps like Fellow, Artisan, and many others

### Switching Between Protocols

To switch between BLE protocols:
1. Long press on the scale display for 3 seconds
2. The display will show the new protocol mode ("BLE Mode: EspressiScale" or "BLE Mode: Acaia")
3. The scale will reconnect with the new protocol mode
4. Connect your app to the scale (it will appear as "EspressiScale" or "Acaia" depending on mode)

### Acaia App Compatibility

When in Acaia-compatible mode, EspressiScale should work with most apps that support Acaia scales, including:
- Fellow (iOS, Android)
- Artisan Roaster Scope
- Brewmaster
- Many espresso machine companion apps

**Note:** This compatibility mode is provided for convenience. For the best experience with dedicated Acaia apps, consider using a genuine Acaia scale.

## Troubleshooting

**WiFi Connection Issues:**
- If you cannot connect to your WiFi network, the scale will remain in access point mode for 5 minutes
- Connect to the "EspressiScale" network (password: `Espress1Scale`) to try again
- If you need to reset the WiFi configuration, restart the scale
